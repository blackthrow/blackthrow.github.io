				<p>This is <em>an experiment</em>.</p>

				<p>To design an operating system for <a
				href="https://telecomix.org/">Telecomix</a>'s blackthrow
				computer.</p>

				<p>A <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/">Raspberry
				Pi</a> as the platform &ndash; affordable, abundant and
				with just enough computing power.</p>

				<p>Controlled via <em>SSH server</em>, the server is reachable
				as a <a
				href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en">
				hidden service</a>. All <em>sessions</em> are forced into
				isolation inside a <a
				href="https://www.docker.com/">container</a>.</p>

				<p>Conducted as a community effort, distributed as a <em>free software</em>.</p>
